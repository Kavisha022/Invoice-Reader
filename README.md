# ðŸ§¾ Invoice PDF Reader using LangChain & Streamlit

This project is a **Streamlit-based web application** that reads invoice PDFs, extracts text, and processes it using **LangChain + OpenAI** to retrieve meaningful information like:

- âœ… Vendor Name  
- âœ… Customer Name  
- âœ… Invoice Date  

It ignores line items, totals, and prices to focus on high-level invoice metadata.
